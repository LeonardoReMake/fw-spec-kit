# STORIES BREAKDOWN

**Created**: [DATE]
**Epic Ticket**: [EPIC_TICKET]
**Max Stories**: [MAX_STORIES]
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse epic description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No epic description provided"
2. Extract business goals and high-level outcomes
   ‚Üí Identify: target users, problems, expected value, constraints
3. Determine number of User Stories for each Epic (‚â§ [MAX_STORIES])
   ‚Üí If fewer than 1: ERROR "Cannot generate user stories"
   ‚Üí If more than [MAX_STORIES]: merge related ones
4. For each User Story:
   ‚Üí Assign short Title (‚â§ 6 words, business-oriented)
   ‚Üí Write Statement in the format: "As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [desired outcome]"
       ‚Üí If missing info: mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
   ‚Üí Write Acceptance Criteria:
       ‚Üí Use GWTS (GIVEN‚ÄìWHEN‚ÄìTHEN‚ÄìSHALL) and/or ITS (IF‚ÄìTHEN‚ÄìSHALL) formats
       ‚Üí Each criterion must be testable, ‚â§ 10 words per part
       ‚Üí Include edge cases
       ‚Üí No more than 7 criteria per story
       ‚Üí If missing info: mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
5. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any technical implementation details detected: ERROR "Remove technical details"
   ‚Üí If Statement or Acceptance Criteria missing mandatory parts: ERROR "Incomplete user story"
   ‚Üí Check against Review & Acceptance Checklist‚Äù (so it‚Äôs explicitly connected)
6. Return: SUCCESS (user stories ready for task decomposition)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any missing or unclear part (persona, action, outcome, acceptance criteria, dependencies)
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn‚Äôt specify something (e.g., who the persona is, or what happens in an edge case), mark it instead of inventing
3. **Think like a product manager**: Each User Story must represent clear business value; vague or overlapping stories should be flagged
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
 - Persona (who exactly performs the action)
 - Desired outcome (why the action is valuable)
 - Acceptance Criteria (edge cases, negative scenarios, measurable results)

## User Stories
### User Story 1
**Title**: [short story name]
**Statement**: [AS A `persona`, I `want to action`, `SO that desired outcome`. Example: As a registered customer, I want to save items to a wishlist, so that I can purchase them later without searching again.]
**Acceptance Criteria (GWTS)**: [GIVEN `the beginning state of the scenario` WHEN `specific action that the user makes` THEN `the entity that is affected by the action` SHALL `the expected outcome or result`. Example:
1. GIVEN the user is logged in WHEN the user clicks "Add to Wishlist" on a product page THEN the wishlist entity SHALL include that product
2. GIVEN the user has an active subscription WHEN the user clicks "Download Report" THEN the reporting service SHALL generate the file and make it available for download]
**Acceptance Criteria (ITS)**: [IF `a certain state or event that occurs` THEN `the entity that is affected` SHALL `the expected outcome or result`. Example:
1. IF the product is already in the wishlist THEN the wishlist SHALL not create a duplicate entry
2. IF the product is out of stock THEN the checkout button SHALL be disabled]
